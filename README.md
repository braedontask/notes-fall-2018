# notes-fall-2018

This is a repository to try and take notes. I decided on Markdown (over LaTeX) because it will allow my to develop locally and easily push and see my changes here on github. Also, LaTeX is a bit cumbersome when it comes to taking quick notes or when attempting to view while working.
